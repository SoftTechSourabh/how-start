            <p>-There is no easy way how to start programming for beginners. If you’re completely new to this sort of
                stuff, it will be nothing like anything you have done previously. Stick with it though. The longer you
                hang in there, the more likely you are to have a “eureka” moment and it will all start making sense.

            </h4>
            <p>AGupieWare is an independent app developer that surveyed computer-science programs from some of the
                leading institutions in the U.S. It then created a similar curriculum based on the free courses offered
                by Stanford, MIT, Carnegie Mellon, Berkeley and Columbia. The program was then broken into 15 courses:
                three introductory classes, seven core classes and five electives.

            <h4>6. GitHub
            </h4>
            <p>Sometimes, you need to recall a reference book when you’re stuck on a problem. That's GitHub, where the
                site says, over 31 million developers collaborate to host and review code, manage projects, and build
                software together. Many programming languages are used here and a Coding Camp teaches the basics.

                the theory behind coding -- you can take advantage of MIT’s free courseware site, which includes classes
                such as Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python, and language-specific courses like

                institutions. With step-by-step video tutorials, you can learn how to program drawings, animations and
                games using JavaScript and ProcessingJS, or learn how to create webpages with HTML and CSS. See,
                especially, Khan's "Hour of Code," designed to introduce students to one hour of computer science and
                computer programming.

                joining this nonprofit's community of professionals and students. You’ll even work together on your
                coding skills so that you can build apps for free. Here’s the catch: You’re learning those skills and
                building helps to help solve real-world problems. Code is available to nonprofits.

                HTML5 code. Because this site's offerings are more advanced than most introductory courses, you'll need
                some knowledge and experience before jumping in.
